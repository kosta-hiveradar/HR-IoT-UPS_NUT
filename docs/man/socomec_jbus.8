These are typically provided with a Netvision WEB/SNMP management card / external box that would be better served by the \fBsnmp-ups\fR(8) driver\&. In case netvision isn\(cqt available, you can hook up the UPS directly via the serial port and use this driver\&.
.sp
Currently, it has only been tested on the following model\&.

In theory, any Socomec JBUS model should work\&. It should be discovered as \(lqUnknown Socomec JBUS\(rq with a numeric id that I\(cqll need to add it to the list of supported UPSs\&.
.sp
Sadly, Socomec document only mentions DELPHYS MX and DELPHYS MX elite and I have the id of my own DIGYS, so chances are, your model will not be recognized but will probably mostly work\&. Please report successful or unsuccessful results to the bug tracker or the mailing list\&. Make sure to include the full model number of your UPS manually in your report\&.
.sp
socomec_jbus uses the libmodbus project, for Modbus implementation\&.
.SH "CABLING"
.sp
The UPS has an RS\-232 port which should be connected with a NULL\-modem cable to a PC serial port\&. The UPS tested has a female DB9 connector, so if you construct the cable yourself, make note of the connector type to avoid using gender changers\&.
.sp
RS\-232 is supported on all operating systems, either via a built\-in serial port on your computer, or by using an external USB\-to\-RS\-232 converter\&. If you plan to use an USB\-to\-RS\-232 converter, make sure it\(cqs supported by your operating system\&.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.sp
This driver should be built by default if libmodbus and development headers are available\&. You can force the configure script to build it with the following arguments:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
:; \&./configure \-\-with\-serial=yes \-\-with\-modbus=yes
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You also need to give proper (R/W) permissions on the local serial device file to allow the NUT driver run\-time user to access it\&. This may need additional setup for start\-up scripting, udev or upower rules, to apply the rights on every boot \(em especially if your device nodes are tracked by a virtual filesystem\&.
.sp
For example, a USB\-to\-serial converter can be identified as /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux, or /dev/ttyU0 on FreeBSD (note the capital "U")\&. A built\-in serial port can be identified as /dev/ttyS0 on Linux or one of /dev/cua* names on FreeBSD\&.
.SH "INSTANT COMMANDS"
.sp
This driver does not (yet?) support sending commands to the UPS\&.
.SH "VARIABLES"
.sp
This driver does not support writable runtime variables (see \fBupsrw\fR(8)): for the same reasons\&. Both should be trivial to implement, but since I\(cqve already found one or two inconsistencies in the documentation, I\(cqm withholding from trying them\&.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS"
.sp
Well, it is an alpha release at best, but so far appears to report the UPS status reliably\&. Mostly based on the work of Yifeng Li <tomli@tomli\&.me> on the \fBhuawei-ups2000\fR(8) in that very same source tree\&.
.SS "Read failure on some JBUS addresses"
.sp
The driver polls all documented JBUS addresses, and it is quite possible that your UPS model does not support one of them (e\&.g\&. the Digys does not support address \fI0x1020\fR which should provide the current UPS status)\&. This should be logged with LOG_ERR from modbus_read_input_registers() along with the address that produced the error\&.
.SS "Data stale"
.sp
Under certain circumstances, some registers can return invalid values and trigger a "data stale" error\&. Once a data stale error has occurred, you should see error messages similar to the example below in the system log\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
socomec_jbus: modbus_read_input_registers(addr:XXXX, count:Z):
    Illegal data address
upsd: Data for UPS [socomec] is stale \- check driver
upsd: UPS [socomec] data is no longer stale
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
So far all known problems have been fixed by the author, but an unknown one cannot be ruled out\&. If you have encountered "data stale" problems during normal uses, please file a bug report with full logs attached\&.
.sp
Before troubleshooting or reporting a problem, it\(cqs important to check your \fBdmesg\fR log for USB connect and disconnect events to avoid wasting time on the NUT driver when the actual problem is USB\&. For example, if someone yanks the cable out of the USB port, or if a new USB device is plugged into a USB host/hub that is struggling to power its ports (common on single\-board computers like Raspberry Pi), or if you have flaky cabling or EMI noise, the serial converter can get disconnected from USB, at least briefly\&. This creates a permanent data stale, the driver must be restarted (plugging the USB back won\(cqt fix it, since the driver is still using the nonexistent serial device)\&. These USB problems usually have nothing to do with NUT\&. If it\(cqs the case, you should solve the underlying USB problem \(em check the cable, check the converter, try a powered USB hub, try a full\-speed USB isolator, etc\&.
