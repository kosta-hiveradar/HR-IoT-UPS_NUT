The UPS2000 series has two variants: UPS2000\-A with a tower chassis, and UPS2000\-G with a rack\-mount chassis\&. Within these two variants, there are also two sub\-variants: a standard runtime model powered by an internal battery pack denoted by an "S" suffix, and a long runtime model powered by an external battery pack denoted by an "L" suffix\&.
.sp
All of these models should be equally supported, but more testers are needed\&. Currently, it has been tested on the following models\&.

If your model is not in the list, we encourage you to report successful or unsuccessful results to the bug tracker or the mailing list\&. Make sure to include the full model number of your UPS manually in your report, because many units only report themselves as "UPS2000\-A" regardless of their models, including the G series\&.
.sp
As of 2022, there is also a new hardware variant with a WCH CH341 USB\-to\-serial chip instead of a MaxLinear/Exar RX21V1410 chip and reports itself as "UPS2000G"\&. Driver support has been added since v0\&.03\&.
.sp
huawei\-ups2000 uses the libmodbus project, for Modbus implementation\&.
.SH "CABLING"
.sp
The UPS has a USB port and a RS\-232 port\&. Both are supported, but on most UPS models, USB is only usable on Linux 5\&.12 and later, via the \fBxr_serial\fR kernel module\&. But for the newer hardware variant with a WCH CH341 chip, it should have better compatibility via the \fBch341\fR kernel module\&. See subsection \fBUSB\fR for details\&. On the other hand, RS\-232 is always supported on all operating systems\&.
.sp
Only one port can be used at a time\&. When USB is used, RS\-232 should be unplugged from the UPS, and vice versa\&. Further, optional adapter cards, such as RS\-485 or SNMP, are not supported\&. They should be removed from the UPS\&.
.sp
Because the UPS port can be unresponsive under certain circumstances, it\(cqs recommended to power cycle your UPS after making a cabling change, especially after changing the port type\&. That is, turn off the UPS power output via the front panel, then unplug the UPS from line power input\&. Wait for the LCD screen to go black\&. Finally reconnect line power and restart your UPS\&.
.SS "USB"
.sp
The USB port on the UPS2000 is originally powered by a MaxLinear/Exar RX21V1410 USB\-to\-serial converter chip, it\(cqs only supported by Linux 5\&.12 or newer, via the \fBxr_serial\fR kernel module\&. Its \fBlsusb\fR report is:
.sp

However, a recent hardware variant switched to the WCH CH341 serial chip:

.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If your unit has a WCH CH341 chip (likely only found in units made after 2022), when the UPS2000 is connected via USB, you should see the following logs in \fBdmesg\fR\&.
.sp
.if n \{\

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If so, you should be able to proceed without worrying about kernel compatibility\&. This CH341 chip has been around for a decade and should be compatible with your system\&.
.sp
On the other hand, if your unit has a MaxLinear/Exar XR21V1410 chip, like most users do, when the UPS2000 is connected via USB to a supported Linux system, you should see the following logs in \fBdmesg\fR\&.
.sp

On an unsupported system, the XR21V1410 USB device can still be recognized as a USB ACM device, but communication is impossible, please don\(cqt waste your time on \fBcdc_acm\fR\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
If you\(cqre already running on Linux 5\&.12 or newer kernels, but still cannot see the \fBxr_serial\fR driver, it means the driver is not enabled in your kernel build\&. If you\(cqre a regular user, you should file a bug report to your Linux distro maintainers and ask them to enable \fBxr_serial\fR (kernel option CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_XR)\&.
.sp
When upgrading the Linux kernel isn\(cqt an option, or when you are using another operating system (e\&.g\&. FreeBSD), RS\-232 must be used\&. Even for CH341 users, one can try this option if USB somehow refuses to work\&.
.SS "RS\-232"
.sp
RS\-232 is supported on all operating systems, either via a built\-in serial port on your computer, or by using an external USB\-to\-RS\-232 converter\&. If you plan to use an USB\-to\-RS\-232 converter, make sure it\(cqs supported by your operating system\&.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.sp
This driver may be not built by default\&. You can build it by installing libmodbus (with development packages) and running
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
configure \-\-with\-serial=yes \-\-with\-modbus=yes
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You also need to give proper (R/W) permissions on the local serial device file to allow the NUT driver run\-time user to access it\&. This may need additional setup for start\-up scripting, udev or upower rules, to apply the rights on every boot \(em especially if your device nodes are tracked by a virtual filesystem\&.
.sp
For example, a USB\-to\-serial converter can be identified as /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux, or /dev/ttyU0 on FreeBSD (note the capital "U")\&. A built\-in serial port can be identified as /dev/ttyS0 on Linux or one of /dev/cua* names on FreeBSD\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"

\fBoffdelay\fR, you should also adjust
\fBrebootdelay\fR\&.
.RE
.PP

Normally, the load is turned on as soon as line power is back\&. But if line power is never lost, or has came back unexpectedly in the middle of an ongoing shutdown (an undesirable "power race" condition that many entry\-level products on the market fail to recover from), the load is turned on after an \fBondelay\fR\&. Thus, UPS2000 is unaffected by a power race, the load is guaranteed to always restart\&.

The driver has a basic foolproof mechanism\&. If the bypass input is already abnormal due to a power failure, the driver refuses to enter bypass mode by aborting the command and logging an error\&.

.\}
.sp
So far all known problems have been fixed by the author, but an unknown one cannot be ruled out\&. If you have encountered "data stale" problems during normal uses, please file a bug report with full logs attached\&.
.sp
Before troubleshooting or reporting a problem, it\(cqs important to check your \fBdmesg\fR log for USB connect and disconnect events to avoid wasting time on the NUT driver when the actual problem is USB\&.
.sp
For example, if someone yanks the cable out of the USB port, or if a new USB device is plugged into a USB host/hub that is struggling to power its ports (common on single\-board computers like Raspberry Pi), or if you have flaky cabling or EMI noise, due to all these and similar reasons the serial converter can get disconnected from USB, at least briefly\&.
.sp
This creates a permanent data stale situation, and the driver must be restarted (plugging the USB back won\(cqt fix it, since the driver is still using the nonexistent serial device, if the system kernel initializes a new device driver instance internally)\&.
.sp
These USB problems usually have nothing to do with NUT\&. If it\(cqs the case, you should solve the underlying USB problem \(em check the cable, check the converter, try a powered USB hub, try a full\-speed USB isolator, etc\&.
.SS "Serial port becomes unresponsive"
.sp
Some malformed commands are known to lock up the serial port (including USB, which is a USB\-to\-serial device)\&. Upon receiving them, UPS2000 stops all serial communications\&. The result is a completely unresponsive UPS, regardless of what you do \(em restarting NUT, rebooting the computer \(em can not restore connectivity, as if someone has unplugged the RS\-232 cable\&.
.sp
To recover, simply power cycle the UPS: Turn off the UPS output via the front panel, then unplug the UPS from line power\&. Wait for the LCD front screen to go black\&. Finally reconnect line power and restart your UPS\&.
.sp
That being said, a serial port lockup is unlikely to happen\&. To our best knowledge, this driver never sends malformed commands to the UPS (it was only a problem during early development)\&. Furthermore, due to a CRC checksum, they\(cqre unlikely to be accidentally generated\&.
.sp
Still, we recommend to power cycle your UPS after making a cabling change, especially after changing from RS\-485/USB to RS\-232, just to ensure the UPS selects the correct communication interface\&. Also, if you have discovered a reproducible serial port lockup problem, it can be a previously unknown bug, so please make sure to file a bug report\&.
.SS "USB chip (MaxLinear/Exar RX21V1410) is unsupported"
.sp
As previously stated, only RS\-232 is supported on all systems\&. On most UPS units, the USB chip RX21V1410 is used, and it requires a device\-specific driver \fBxr_serial\fR, which is only available on Linux 5\&.12 and newer kernels\&.
.sp
On an unsupported system, the USB device can still be recognized as a USB ACM device, but in reality, communication is impossible\&. It can only be fixed by implementing a driver for your system, nothing can be done within NUT\&. Please use the RS\-232 port instead\&.
.sp
Alternatively, if your unit has a WCH CH341 chip (likely only found in units made after 2022), it should have better compatibility\&.
.sp
See the previous section \fBCabling\fR for more information\&.
.sp
Finally, in the unlike scenario that you are using NUT on Microsoft Windows, you should be able to install the USB device driver following the steps in the Huawei UPS2000 (1 kVA\-3 kVA) Modbus Protocol Development Guide\&.
