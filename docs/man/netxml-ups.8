netxml\-ups supports all recent Eaton / MGE models which use a Network Management Card or Proxy (MGE XML/HTTP protocol based)\&. This applies to both Eaton (previously MGE Office Protection Systems) and to MGE UPS SYSTEMS\&. Supported card and proxy models are:

.RE
.sp
Older models, such as SNMP card (Ref 66062 and Ref 66045), use the SNMP protocol and should use the \fBsnmp-ups\fR(8) driver with the mibs=mge parameter\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
This driver supports the following optional settings in the \fBups.conf\fR(5):
.PP
\fBtimeout\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
The timeout for connecting to and reading from the UPS\&. Defaults to 5 seconds\&. Don\(cqt change this value unless you know exactly what you\(cqre doing\&.
.sp
This value
\fBmust never\fR
be higher than half the
MAXAGE
value specified in
\fBupsd.conf\fR(5), otherwise you run the risk that
\fBupsd\fR(8)
declares the driver stale while it is waiting for a connection to timeout\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsubscribe\fR
.RS 4
Connect to the NMC in subscribed mode\&. This allows to receive notifications and alarms more quickly, beside from the standard polling requests\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlogin\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the login value for authenticated mode\&. This feature also needs the
\fBpassword\fR
argument, and allows value settings in the card\&. This feature is not used yet\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpassword\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the password value, needed with the login for authenticated mode\&. This feature is not used yet\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshutdown_duration\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the shutdown duration of the operating system, in seconds\&. This represents the amount of time needed by the system to operate a clean shutdown\&. Defaults to 120 seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshutdown_timer\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the shutdown timer, in seconds\&. After
\fIvalue\fR
seconds running on battery, the local system will receive a notification to shut down\&. Defaults to "none" (disabled)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdo_convert_deci\fR
.RS 4
If this flag value is present, the driver assumes you have a very old MGE networked UPS (or rather an old network management card firmware) which serves certain measurements spelled 10x too big in the XML markup\&.
.sp
Originally such measurements were decimated by the driver \(em but this is wrong for newer, more sane, devices \(em so this behavior was deprecated and is now disabled by default\&. Enabling this flag in configuration of a particular driver instance restores the old behavior for those measurements\&.
.RE
.SH "IMPLEMENTATION"
.sp
The hostname of the networked UPS is specified with the port value in ups\&.conf, i\&.e\&.:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[mgexml]
        driver = netxml\-ups
        port = http://netxml\-ups\&.example\&.com:80
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Specifying the method to connect to the UPS (http, https) is mandatory\&. If the port is equal to the default for the method specified (80 for http, 443 for https) it may be omitted\&.
.sp
In order not to overload older NMCs by polling them too frequently, it is recommended to increase the "pollinterval" (see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)) and \fBups.conf\fR(5)) to at least 5 seconds\&.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.SS "HTTP(S) proxies"
.sp
Don\(cqt connect to the UPS through a proxy\&. Although it would be trivial to add support for proxies, this is not recommended and don\(cqt ask for it\&. Not only because it will prevent the driver to make a persistent connection to the UPS, but also it adds an additional failure mode\&. If the proxy goes down (for whatever reason), the driver will no longer be able to reach the UPS\&.
.SS "Using host names for UPS NMC"
.sp
An UPS network management card may be assigned a fixed/static IP address or a dynamic one (e\&.g\&. by DHCP) in your network\&. Due to this, you may want or have to use a dynamic naming service to access the UPS\&. Note that this may become a problem specifically during large outages and shutdowns, when your DHCP/DNS server might already go down while the driver needs to resolve the name involved (especially during late\-shutdown hooks, when a new instance of the driver program might start just to tell the UPS to power off or to power\-cycle)\&.
.sp
It may be wise to ensure your OS name service client can cache the UPS name sufficiently long, or to use fixed IP addressing (and an entry in /etc/hosts for good measure, so you only have one spot to eventually re\-configure this)\&.
