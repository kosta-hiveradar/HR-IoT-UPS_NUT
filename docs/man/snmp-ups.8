\fBtripplite\fR
.RS 4
TrippLite UPSes; at this time this is the IETF MIB mapping with just the Tripplite entry point OID to verify the device vendor, and a real hardware\-specific configuration will be added in the future development\&.
.RE
.sp
For a complete and up\-to\-date listing, you can query the driver by passing the \fBmibs=\-\-list\fR argument (see below)\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
This driver supports the following optional settings in the \fBups.conf\fR(5):
.PP
\fBport\fR=\fIhostname[:port]\fR
.RS 4
Set SNMP hostname, or IP address, and port number of the peer SNMP agent\&. There is no default for the hostname, but the default port is 161\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmibs\fR=\fI\-\-list\fR
.RS 4
A special option which allows to list the currently known MIB\-to\-NUT mappings and exit the driver binary, intended for command\-line usage like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
:; snmp\-ups \-a snmp\-test \-x mibs=\-\-list
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fBmibs\fR=\fIname\fR
.RS 4
Set MIB compliance (default=\fIauto\fR, allowed entries: refer to SUPPORTED HARDWARE above)\&.
.sp
With "auto", the driver will try a select set of SNMP objects until it finds one that the device responds to\&.
.sp
Note that since NUT 2\&.6\&.2, snmp\-ups has a new method that uses
sysObjectID
(which is a pointer to the preferred MIB of the device) to detect supported devices\&. This renders void the
\fBrequirement\fR
to use the "mibs" option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcommunity\fR=\fIname\fR
.RS 4
Set community name (default is
\fIpublic\fR) for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c connections\&. Note that an RW capable community name is required to change UPS settings and send commands (such as for a power\-down)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsnmp_version\fR=\fIversion\fR
.RS 4
Set SNMP version (default = v1, allowed: v2c, v3)
.RE
.PP
\fBsnmp_retries\fR=\fIretries\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the number of Net\-SNMP retries to be used in the requests (default=5)
.RE
.PP
\fBsnmp_timeout\fR=\fItimeout\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the Net\-SNMP timeout in seconds between retries (default=1)
.RE
.PP
\fBsymmetrathreephase\fR
.RS 4
Enable APCC three phase Symmetra quirks (use on APCC three phase Symmetras): Convert from three phase line\-to\-line voltage to line\-to\-neutral voltage (default: not enabled)
.RE
.PP
\fBpollfreq\fR=\fInum\fR
.RS 4
Set polling interval for full updates, in seconds, to reduce SNMP network traffic relative to the quick updates performed every "pollinterval" (the latter option is described in
\fBups.conf\fR(5))\&. The default value is 30 (in seconds)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnotransferoids\fR
.RS 4
Disable the monitoring of the low and high voltage transfer OIDs in the hardware\&. This will remove input\&.transfer\&.low and input\&.transfer\&.high from the list of variables\&. This should only be used on APCC Symmetra equipment which has strangeness in the three\-phase power reporting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsecLevel\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the securityLevel used for SNMPv3 messages (default=noAuthNoPriv, allowed: authNoPriv,authPriv) This parameter is mandatory if you use non\-trivial authentication\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsecName\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the securityName used for authenticated SNMPv3 messages (no default)
.RE
.PP
\fBauthPassword\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the authentication pass phrase used for authenticated SNMPv3 messages (no default)
.RE
.PP
\fBprivPassword\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the privacy pass phrase used for encrypted SNMPv3 messages (no default)
.RE
.PP
\fBauthProtocol\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the authentication protocol (MD5, SHA, SHA256, SHA384 or SHA512) used for authenticated SNMPv3 messages (default=MD5)\&. Note that the exact protocol list depends on Net\-SNMP library capabilities; check help of the
snmp\-ups
binary program for the run\-time supported list\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBprivProtocol\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the privacy protocol (DES, AES, AES192 or AES256) used for encrypted SNMPv3 messages (default=DES)\&. Note that the exact protocol list depends on Net\-SNMP library capabilities; check help of the
snmp\-ups
binary program for the run\-time supported list\&.
.RE
.SH "REQUIREMENTS"
.sp
You will need to install the Net\-SNMP package from http://www\&.net\-snmp\&.org/ before building this driver\&.
.sp
SNMP v3 also requires OpenSSL support from http://www\&.openssl\&.org\&.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.SS "Shutdown"
.sp
The shutdown sequence should be tested before relying on NUT to send a shutdown command to the UPS\&. The problem is that the host network stack may have been torn down by the time the driver is invoked to send the shutdown command\&. The driver attempts to send shutdown\&.return, shutdown\&.reboot, and load\&.off\&.delay commands to the UPS in sequence, stopping after the first supported command\&.
.SS "Using host names for UPS NMC"
.sp
An UPS network management card may be assigned a fixed/static IP address or a dynamic one (e\&.g\&. by DHCP) in your network\&. Due to this, you may want or have to use a dynamic naming service to access the UPS\&. Note that this may become a problem specifically during large outages and shutdowns, when your DHCP/DNS server might already go down while the driver needs to resolve the name involved (especially during late\-shutdown hooks, when a new instance of the driver program might start just to tell the UPS to power off or to power\-cycle)\&.
.sp
It may be wise to ensure your OS name service client can cache the UPS name sufficiently long, or to use fixed IP addressing (and an entry in /etc/hosts for good measure, so you only have one spot to eventually re\-configure this)\&.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.sp
This driver is only built if the Net\-SNMP development files are present at configuration time\&. You can also force it to be built by using configure \-\-with\-snmp=yes before calling make\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
The hostname of the UPS is specified with the "port" value in ups\&.conf, and may include a non\-standard (161) remote peer port:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        [snmpv1]
                driver = snmp\-ups
                port = snmp\-ups\&.example\&.com
                community = public
                snmp_version = v1
                pollfreq = 15
                desc = "Example SNMP v1 device"

        [snmpv3]
                driver = snmp\-ups
                port = 166\&.99\&.224\&.132:170
                snmp_version = v3
                secLevel = authPriv
                secName = mysecurityname
                authPassword = myauthenticationpassphrase
                privPassword = myprivatepassphrase
                desc = "Example SNMP v3 device, with the highest security level"
