PHOENIXCONTACT_MODBUS(8)
========================

NAME
----

phoenixcontact_modbus - Driver for Phoenix Contact

SYNOPSIS
--------

*phoenixcontact_modbus* -h

*phoenixcontact_modbus* -a 'DEVICE_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
phoenixcontact_modbus driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver should support the PhoenixContact QUINT-UPS industrial DC UPS,
model 2320461 and all compatible models. More information about this UPS
can be found among <<_internet_resources,Internet resources>> below.

phoenixcontact_modbus uses the libmodbus project, for Modbus implementation.

How to configure the UPS
------------------------

Note: this UPS and its manual refers to Low-Batt as "Shutdown Event".

You need the "IFS-RS232-DATACABLE" to communicate with the UPS in Linux
as the IFS-USB cable doesn't seem to be supported. FYI communication
parameters are: `115200,E,8,1`.

You also need the UPS-CONF Windows software (free; download from their
site), to configure the UPS signals and timers.

1. Run the UPS-CONF
2. Go to Settings->Time Setting
3. Choose "state of charge shutdown delay"
4. Choose Remote starts PC-Shutdown in Mains and Battery mode
5. On the PC-Shutdown enter the maximum value (5 minutes)
6. On the PC-Restart delay enter the time you want the UPS to leave
   the output power off before restarting (e.g. 60 seconds), after
   mains power is restored.
7. On the UPS, turn the screw to the "PC-MODE" position

Configuring the above way ensures that:

 * When power is lost, UPS constantly calculates remaining battery time
 * When remaining battery time is less than 5 minutes (PC-Shutdown setting),
   it will raise the "Shutdown" event (seen as LOW-BATT in NUT)
 * From that moment even if input power is restored, the UPS will cut the
   output power to its load after 5 minutes
 * When the input power is restored, the UPS will restore output power
   after 60 seconds (PC-RESTART delay setting).

Meaning of settings:

 * PC-Shutdown: How long before output cutoff the UPS will raise
   the "shutdown event" signal. Max value for this is 5 minutes.
   So PC should be able to shutdown within 5 minutes.
 * PC-Restart: How long to delay output power after power is restored.
   Max is 60 seconds.


EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver doesn't support any optional settings.

INSTALLATION
------------

This driver may be not built by default.  You can build it by installing
libmodbus and running `configure --with-modbus=yes`.

You also need to give proper permissions on the local serial device file
(`/dev/ttyS0` for example) to allow the NUT user to access it.

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver doesn't support any instant commands.

CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES
----------------------

The following variables can be set in the NUT configuration as `default.*`
values to override or monitor UPS behavior using the `phoenixcontact_modbus`
driver.

NOTE: As of NUT v2.8.4, there is currently no support for run-time setting
of these values (e.g. with linkman:upsrw[8]).  Currently they are only
considered once, during driver initialization.

*battery.energysave.delay*='num'::
Time after entering battery mode before PC shutdown signal is triggered
by the UPS (in seconds).

*ups.timer.shutdown*='num'::
Time allowed for PC to shutdown (in seconds). Maximum is 300 seconds.

*ups.timer.start*='num'::
Duration for which output power remains turned off before rebooting the
PC system back on (in seconds).

*ups.delay.start*='num'::
Delay before switching back to mains after power is restored (in seconds).
The mains voltage must be within the threshold for this time, to initiate
automatic PC restart.

*experimental.ups.mode.selector*='num'::
UPS operating mode. For example, `9` corresponds to PC-Mode (vendor-defined).

*experimental.battery.warning_soh*='num'::
Battery warning threshold for State of Health, in percent.

*input.voltage.low.critical*='num'::
Threshold voltage (in V) below which the UPS will switch to battery mode.

*input.voltage.high.critical*='num'::
Voltage threshold (in V) above which the UPS will consider mains power restored
(see also below).
