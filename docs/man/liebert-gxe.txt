LIEBERT-GXE(8)
===============

NAME
----

liebert-gxe - Driver for Liebert GXE series UPS, using the YDN23 serial protocol

SYNOPSIS
--------

*liebert-gxe* -h

*liebert-gxe* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
liebert-gxe driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

Tested to work on the following units:

* Liebert GXE 01k00TS1101C00
+
NOTE: This UPS has an RS-232 port and a USB port. The USB port has an
ACM interface which functions as a serial port for the host operating
system. Both ports can be used managing the device.

This is an experimental driver.  You have been warned.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in linkman:ups.conf[5]:

*addr=*'num'::
Set the address of the UPS -- 01 (default) ~ 99.

*retry=*'num'::
Set the max times of read failures. (UPS sometimes ignores the incoming
command and causes driver stales. The driver will ignore *retry* failures if
occurred in a row. However, this does increase the latency if a real stale
happened. Default to 3)
