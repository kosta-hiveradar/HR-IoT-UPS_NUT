upsd.conf \- Configuration for Network UPS Tools upsd data server
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBupsd\fR(8) uses this file to control access to the server and set some other miscellaneous configuration values\&. This file contains details on access controls, so keep it secure\&. Ideally, only the upsd process should be able to read it\&.

Balance the run\-time user permissions to access the file (and perhaps the directory it is in) for only
upsd
to be able to read it; write access is not needed\&. It is common to use
chown root:nut
and
chmod 640
to set up acceptable file permissions\&.

Packages (and build recipes) typically prepare one set of user and group accounts for NUT\&. Custom builds with minimal configuration might even use
nobody:nogroup

On systems with extra security concerns, NUT drivers and data server should run as separate user accounts which would be members of one same group for shared access to local Unix socket files and the directory they are in, but different groups for configuration file access\&. This would need some daemons to use customized
user,
group,
RUN_AS_USER
and/or
RUN_AS_GROUP
settings to override the single built\-in value\&.

.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES"
.PP
\fBMAXAGE \fR\fB\fIseconds\fR\fR
.RS 4
upsd
usually allows a driver to stop responding for up to 15 seconds before declaring the data "stale"\&. If your driver takes a very long time to process updates but is otherwise operational, you can use
MAXAGE
to make
upsd
wait longer\&.
.sp
Most users should leave this at the default value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBTRACKINGDELAY \fR\fB\fIseconds\fR\fR
.RS 4
When instant commands and variables setting status tracking is enabled, status execution information are kept during this amount of time, and then cleaned up\&. This defaults to 3600 (1 hour)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBALLOW_NO_DEVICE \fR\fB\fIBoolean\fR\fR
.RS 4
Normally upsd requires that at least one device section is defined in ups\&.conf when the daemon starts, to serve its data\&. For automatically managed services it may be preferred to have upsd always running, and reload the configuration when power devices become defined\&.
.sp
Boolean values
\fItrue\fR,
\fIyes\fR,
\fIon\fR
and
\fI1\fR
mean that the server would not refuse to start with zero device sections found in ups\&.conf\&.
.sp
Boolean values
\fIfalse\fR,
\fIno\fR,
\fIoff\fR
and
\fI0\fR
mean that the server should refuse to start if zero device sections were found in ups\&.conf\&. This is the default, unless the calling environment sets a same\-named variable to enforce a value for the current run\&. One way this can happen is somebody un\-commenting it in the
\fInut\&.conf\fR
file used by init\-scripts and service unit method scripts\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBALLOW_NOT_ALL_LISTENERS \fR\fB\fIBoolean\fR\fR
.RS 4
Normally upsd requires that all
LISTEN
directives can be honoured at the moment the daemon starts\&. If your LAN IP address (or host name) used in one of the
LISTEN
directives may be not always accessible, and for some reason do not want to just
LISTEN *
on the wildcard interface, but e\&.g\&. you still want to use
upsmon
on
localhost, this option can help\&. Note you would have to restart
upsd
to pick up the
LISTEN\*(Aqed IP address if it appears later\&.
.sp
Boolean values
\fItrue\fR,
\fIyes\fR,
\fIon\fR
and
\fI1\fR
mean that the server would not refuse to start if it can listen on at least one interface\&.
.sp
Boolean values
\fIfalse\fR,
\fIno\fR,
\fIoff\fR
and
\fI0\fR
mean that the server should refuse to start if it can not LISTEN on each and every (non\-localhost) interface found in upsd\&.conf\&. This is the default, unless the calling environment sets a same\-named variable to enforce a value for the current run\&. One way this can happen is somebody un\-commenting it in the
\fInut\&.conf\fR
file used by init\-scripts and service unit method scripts\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSTATEPATH \fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.RS 4
Tell
upsd
to look for the driver state sockets in
\fIpath\fR
rather than the default that was compiled into the program\&.
.sp
Note that the drivers must use the same path, so
upsd
would prefer the same\-named setting from
ups\&.conf
global section, if present, over its own\&.
.sp
Environment variable
NUT_STATEPATH
set by caller (e\&.g\&. init script or service method) can override this setting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLISTEN \fR\fB\fIinterface\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR
.RS 4
Bind a listening port to the interface specified by its Internet address or name\&. This may be useful on hosts with multiple interfaces\&. You should not rely exclusively on this for security, as it can be subverted on many systems\&.
.sp
Optionally listen on TCP port
\fIport\fR
instead of the default value which was compiled into the code\&. This overrides any value you may have set with
configure \-\-with\-port\&. If you don\(cqt change it with configure or this value,
upsd
will listen on port
\fI3493\fR
for this interface\&.
.sp
Multiple
LISTEN
addresses may be specified\&. The default is to bind to
127\&.0\&.0\&.1
if no
LISTEN
addresses are specified (and also
::1
if IPv6 support is compiled in)\&.
.sp
To listen on all available interfaces and configured IP addresses of your system, you may also use
::
for IPv6 and
0\&.0\&.0\&.0
for IPv4, respectively\&. As a special case, a single
LISTEN * <port>
directive (with an asterisk) will try to listen on both IPv6 (::0) and IPv4 (0\&.0\&.0\&.0) wild\-card IP addresses, subject to
upsd
command\-line arguments or system configuration\&. Note that if the system supports IPv4\-mapped IPv6 addressing per RFC\-3493, and does not allow to disable this mode, then there may be one listening socket to handle both address families\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.sp
This parameter will only be read at startup\&. You\(cqll need to restart (rather than merely reload)
upsd
to apply any changes made here\&.
.sp
Please note that older NUT releases could have been using the IPv4\-mapped IPv6 addressing (sometimes also known as "dual\-stack") mode, if provided by the system\&. Current versions (since NUT v2\&.8\&.1 release) explicitly try to restrict their listening sockets to only support one address family on each socket, and so avoid IPv4\-mapped mode where possible\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMAXCONN \fR\fB\fIconnections\fR\fR
.RS 4
This defaults to maximum number allowed on your system\&. Each UPS, each
LISTEN
address and each client count as one connection\&. If the server runs out of connections, it will no longer accept new incoming client connections\&. Only set this if you know exactly what you\(cqre doing\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCERTFILE \fR\fB\fIcertificate file\fR\fR
.RS 4
When compiled with SSL support with OpenSSL backend, you can enter the certificate file here\&.
.sp
The certificates must be in PEM format and must be sorted starting with the subject\(cqs certificate (server certificate), followed by intermediate CA certificates (if applicable) and the highest level (root) CA\&. It should end with the server key\&. See
docs/security\&.txt
in NUT sources, or the Security chapter of NUT user manual, for more information on the SSL support in NUT\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCERTPATH \fR\fB\fIcertificate database\fR\fR
.RS 4
When compiled with SSL support with NSS backend, you can enter the certificate path here\&.
.sp
Certificates are stored in a dedicated database (data split in 3 files)\&. Specify the path of the database directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCERTIDENT \fR\fB\fIcertificate name\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIdatabase password\fR\fR

\fBDISABLE_WEAK_SSL \fR\fB\fIBOOLEAN\fR\fR
.RS 4
Tell
upsd
to disable older/weak SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers\&. With relatively recent versions of OpenSSL or NSS it will be restricted to TLSv1\&.2 or better\&.
.sp
Unless you have really ancient clients, you probably want to enable this\&. Currently disabled by default to ensure compatibility with existing setups\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDEBUG_MIN \fR\fB\fIINTEGER\fR\fR
.RS 4
Optionally specify a minimum debug level for
upsd
data daemon, e\&.g\&. for troubleshooting a deployment, without impacting foreground or background running mode directly\&. Command\-line option
\-D
can only increase this verbosity level\&.
.if n \{\

\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
If the running daemon receives a
reload
command, presence of the
DEBUG_MIN NUMBER
value in the configuration file can be used to tune debugging verbosity in the running service daemon (it is recommended to comment it away or set the minimum to explicit zero when done, to avoid huge journals and I/O system abuse)\&. Keep in mind that for this run\-time tuning, the
DEBUG_MIN
value
\fBpresent\fR
in
\fBreloaded\fR
configuration files is applied instantly and overrides any previously set value, from file or CLI options, regardless of older logging level being higher or lower than the newly found number; a missing (or commented away) value however does not change the previously active logging verbosity\&.
