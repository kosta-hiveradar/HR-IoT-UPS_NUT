This could be a device filesystem path like
/dev/usb/hiddev0
but current use of libusb API precludes knowing and matching by such identifiers\&. They may also be inherently unreliable (dependent on re\-plugging and enumeration order)\&. At this time the actual
\fIvalue\fR
is ignored, but syntactically some
\fIport\fR
configuration must still be there\&.

It is possible to control multiple UPS units simultaneously by running several instances of this driver, provided they can be uniquely distinguished by setting some combination of the \fBvendor\fR, \fBproduct\fR, \fBvendorid\fR, \fBproductid\fR, \fBserial\fR, \fBbus\fR and/or \fBdevice\fR options detailed below\&. For devices or operating systems that do not provide sufficient information, the \fBallow_duplicates\fR option can be of use (limited and risky!)

\fBvendorid =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBproductid =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBvendor =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBproduct =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBserial =\fR \fIregex\fR
.RS 4
Select a specific UPS, in case there is more than one connected via USB\&. Each option specifies an extended regular expression (see
\fBregex\fR(7)
for more information on regular expressions), which must match the UPS\(cqs entire respective
vendor/product/serial
string values (minus any surrounding whitespace), or the whole 4\-digit hexadecimal code for
vendorid
and
productid\&.
.sp
Try
\fBlsusb\fR(8)
or running this NUT driver with
\-DD
command\-line argument for finding out the strings to match\&.

If supported by the hardware, OS and libusb on the particular deployment, this option should allow to specify physical port numbers on an USB hub, rather than logical
device
enumeration values, and in turn \(em this should be less volatile across reboots or re\-plugging\&. The value may be seen in the USB topology output of
lsusb \-tv
on systems with that tool, for example\&.

If you have several UPS devices which may not be uniquely identified by the options above (e\&.g\&. only
\fIVID:PID\fR
can be discovered there), this flag allows each driver instance where it is set to take the first match if available, or proceed to try another\&.
.sp
Normally the driver initialization would abort at this point claiming "Resource busy" or similar error, assuming that the otherwise properly matched device is unique \(em and some other process already handles it\&.

This feature is inherently non\-deterministic! The association of driver instance name to actual device may vary between runs!
.sp
If you only care to know that
\fBat least\fR
one of your no\-name UPSes is online, this option can help\&.

If you must really know
\fBwhich\fR
one, it will not!

\fBusb_set_altinterface =\fR \fIbAlternateSetting\fR

Force redundant call to
usb_set_altinterface(), especially if needed for devices serving multiple USB roles where the UPS is not represented by the interface number
0
(default)\&.
.RE

\fBusb_config_index\fR, \fBusb_hid_rep_index\fR, \fBusb_hid_desc_index\fR, \fBusb_hid_ep_in\fR, \fBusb_hid_ep_out\fR

Force use of specific interface, endpoint, descriptor index etc\&. numbers, rather than defaulting to
\fI0\fR
(rarely other values in certain drivers for some devices known to use non\-zero numbers)\&. Specified as a hexadecimal number\&.
.sp
As a rule of thumb for
usb_hid_desc_index
discovery, you can see larger
wDescriptorLength
values (roughly 600+ bytes) in reports of
lsusb
or similar tools\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLIBUSB_DEBUG =\fR \fIINTEGER\fR
.RS 4
Run\-time troubleshooting of USB\-capable NUT drivers can involve not only raising the common NUT debug verbosity (e\&.g\&. using the
DEBUG_MIN
setting in
\fBups.conf\fR(5)
or protocol commands to change the
driver\&.debug
value), but may also benefit from LibUSB specific debugging\&.
.sp
For the latter, you can set the
LIBUSB_DEBUG
driver option; alternatively you can classically export the environment variable
LIBUSB_DEBUG
before starting a NUT driver program (may be set and "exported" in driver init script or service method, perhaps via
\fBnut.conf\fR(5)), to a numeric value such as
4
("All messages are emitted")\&.

You may need to tweak some settings, depending on the make and model of your UPS (see \fBups.conf\fR(5)):
.PP
\fBlocalcalculation\fR
.RS 4
When enabled, driver will calculate values of
battery\&.runtime
and
battery\&.charge
"locally" in the driver\&. This is for some Riello models (iPlug and iDialog series) which provide incorrect values in hardware readings, or none at all\&. This "local calculation" is done according to nominal battery capacity, nominal battery voltage, actual battery charge, maximum and actual UPS load\&.
.sp
You may want to also configure
\fIdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.low\fR
and
\fIdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.high\fR
in case the built\-in default range (from 10\&.7V to 12\&.9V) does not match your hardware, or give a shot to
\fIdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.nominal\fR
(e\&.g\&.
\fI24\fR) if your device does not serve that either\&.

Lead (PbAc) battery charge graph is not linear, so guesstimated charge value may not be perfectly accurate\&. However it should be good enough to determine battery actual status and roughly estimate the time it can still power the system\&.
