SOLIS(8)
========

NAME
----

solis - Driver for Brazilian Microsol SOLIS UPS equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*solis* -h

*solis* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
solis driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver has been tested with:

 * Solis   1000 VA
 * Solis   1500 VA
 * Solis   2000 VA
 * Solis   3000 VA
 * Back-UPS BZ1200-BR
 * Back-UPS BZ2200BI-BR

All Solis models are sinusoidal on-line.

In 2009, Schneider Electric acquired Microsol Technologies, and by 2012, the
entire Microsol line of equipment was being sold under the APC brand. Newer
devices may be better supported by linkman:microsol-apc[8] driver instead.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver support the following extra optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5].

*battext=*'n'::
Default = 0, no extra battery, where `n` = Ampere*hour.

*prgshut=*'n'::
Default = 0, no programmable shutdown; `1` to enable one.

COMMANDS
--------

*shutdown.return*::
Shut down in .3 minutes and restart in .3 minutes after that.

*shutdown.stayoff*::
Shut down in .3 minutes and do not return.

ISSUES
------

The APC version of the Microsol protocol is slightly incompatible with the
*solis* driver. As of version 0.62 of the *solis* driver, the driver will
connect to the UPS, but some values are read incorrectly.
