LIBUPSCLIENT-CONFIG(1)
======================

NAME
----

libupsclient-config - Script to get information about the installed
version of libupsclient

SYNOPSIS
--------

*libupsclient-config* [--version] [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*libupsclient-config* is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and
linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use the
*libupsclient* from the Network UPS Tools project (also known as the "upscli"
API).

It allows to simplify build automation for systems without a `pkg-config`
implementation which would instead use the `libupsclient.pc` file installed
with the NUT development files.

Note that to rebuild current NUT with same settings as the installed NUT
v2.8.1 or newer, you can use `lib/libupsclient-config --config-flags`,
where supported.  Note that the `pkg-config` manifest `libupsclient.pc` does
not easily convey this information.

OPTIONS
-------

*libupsclient-config* accepts the following options:

*--version*::
Print the currently installed version of *libupsclient* on the standard output.

*--libs*::
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a *libupsclient* program.

*--cflags*::
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a *libupsclient* program.

*--config-flags*::
Print the flags passed to `configure` script when this installation of NUT
was originally built (supported since release v2.8.1).
