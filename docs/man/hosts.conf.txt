HOSTS.CONF(5)
=============

NAME
----

hosts.conf - Access control for Network UPS Tools CGI programs

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The CGI programs (linkman:upsset.cgi[8], linkman:upsstats.cgi[8],
linkman:upsimage.cgi[8]) use this file to determine if they are allowed to
talk to a host.  This keeps random visitors from using your web server
to annoy others by creating outgoing connections.

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

* Contents of this file should be pure ASCII (character codes
  not in range would be ignored with a warning message).
* This file does not contain passwords. Read-only monitoring in NUT is
  anonymous, and the linkman:upsset[8] program asks for credentials in
  the browser session when commanding a particular UPS (web-server should
  be secured, as reported to the program by linkman:upsset.conf[5] file).

DIRECTIVES
----------

*MONITOR* 'ups' 'description'::

The 'ups' element is in the form `upsname[@hostname[:port]]`.
+
To allow connections to an UPS called "snoopy" on a system called
"doghouse" that runs `upsd` on port 7877, it would look like this:

	MONITOR snoopy@doghouse:7877 "Joe Cool"
+
The description must be one element, so if it has spaces, then it must
be wrapped with quotes as shown above.  The default hostname is
"localhost".
