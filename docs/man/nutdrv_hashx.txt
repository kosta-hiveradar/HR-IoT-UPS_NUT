NUTDRV_HASHX(8)
===============

NAME
----

nutdrv_hashx - Driver for #* protocol serial based UPS equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*nutdrv_hashx* -h

*nutdrv_hashx* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
*nutdrv_hashx* driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

The protocol originates from Cyber Energy that apparently developed the
protocol for their UPS and it was used then by various other vendors
(that in some cases they just re-brand the Cyber Energy products).

The *nutdrv_hashx* driver is expected to work with various UPSes from
'Ablerex', 'Atlantis Land', 'Epyc', 'Infosec', 'ION', 'PowerWalker',
'Right Power Technology', 'Salicru', 'UPS Solutions' and various others.

Long story short: if your UPS came with a software called 'PowerMaster+'
(or the older 'PowerMaster' and 'PowerGuide'), chances are high that it
works with this driver.

Only devices with a serial interface are supported.

KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS
---------------------

The driver has only been tested with a single line-interactive device
(Atlantis Land A03-S1200) so far, thus the protocol reverse engineering
has been currently limited to what such device supports.

Thus the lack of these features:

* Specific support for PDU or ATS devices.
* Detection of the UPS type (line-interactive / online).
* Detection of max/min voltage ratings.
* Detection of load banks.
* Detection of Extended battery modules.
* Detection of Over voltage state.
* Detection of Under voltage state.
* Detection of Frequency failure state.
* Detection of Wiring Fault state.
* Detection of lack of Neutral line connection.
* Detection of UPS generators.
* Detection of other Battery / UPS error states.
* Reading of actual Voltage, Frequency, Current, Power factor, Temperature values.
* Reading the status of the battery packs.
* Bypass modes usage and detection.
* USB Support (PM+ mentions being it supported, unsure if with the same protocol).

The driver shutdown function is not implemented (while it's supported), so other
arrangements must be made to turn off the UPS.
