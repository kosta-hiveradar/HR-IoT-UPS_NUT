RIELLO_SER(8)
=============

NAME
----

riello_ser - Driver for Riello UPS Protocol UPS equipment via serial port connections

SYNOPSIS
--------

*riello_ser* -h

*riello_ser* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
riello_ser driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

riello_ser supports all recent Riello UPS, Aros UPS models which use the Riello
UPS GPSER and SENTR protocols.

Older Riello UPS products are not supported.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

You may need to tweak some settings, depending on the make and model of your
UPS (see linkman:ups.conf[5]):

*localcalculation*::
When enabled, driver will calculate values of `battery.runtime` and
`battery.charge` "locally" in the driver. This is for some Riello models
which provide incorrect values in hardware readings, or none at all.
This "local calculation" is done according to nominal battery capacity,
nominal battery voltage, actual battery charge, maximum and actual UPS
load.
+
You may want to also configure 'default.battery.voltage.low' and
'default.battery.voltage.high' in case the built-in default range
(from 10.7V to 12.9V) does not match your hardware, or give a shot
to 'default.battery.voltage.nominal' (e.g. '24') if your device does
not serve that either.
+
NOTE: Lead (PbAc) battery charge graph is not linear, so guesstimated
charge value may not be perfectly accurate. However it should be good
enough to determine battery actual status and roughly estimate the time
it can still power the system.
+
WARNING: This keyword may be deprecated in future releases of the driver,
in favor of `runtimecal` and other settings which it requires (as seen in
linkman:nutdrv_qx[8], linkman:blazer_ser[8] and linkman:blazer_usb[8] drivers).
