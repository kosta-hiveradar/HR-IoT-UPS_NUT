Using host names for UPS NMC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An UPS network management card may be assigned a fixed/static IP address or
a dynamic one (e.g. by DHCP) in your network.  Due to this, you may want or
have to use a dynamic naming service to access the UPS.  Note that this may
become a problem specifically during large outages and shutdowns, when your
DHCP/DNS server might already go down while the driver needs to resolve the
name involved (especially during late-shutdown hooks, when a new instance
of the driver program might start just to tell the UPS to power off or to
power-cycle).

It may be wise to ensure your OS name service client can cache the UPS name
sufficiently long, or to use fixed IP addressing (and an entry in `/etc/hosts`
for good measure, so you only have one spot to eventually re-configure this).
