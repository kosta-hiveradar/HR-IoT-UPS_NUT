    <authorinitials>JK</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Some changes to API, docs and recipes, in particular to simplify local
        builds and tests (e.g. to help end-users check if current NUT codebase
        trunk has already fixed an issue they see with a packaged installation).

    <revnumber>2.8.0</revnumber>
    <date>2022-04-26</date>
    <authorinitials>JK</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Change of maintainer.
        Many changes to API, docs (both style and content), and recipes,
        with a stress on non-regression test-ability, run-time debug-ability,
        general codebase maintainability, as well as OS integrations (notably
        nut-driver-enumerator for systemd and SMF service instance maintenance).
        Added a lot in area of CI support and documented pre-requisite package
        lists for numerous platforms, and CI agent set-up. Added libusb-1.x
        support and many new driver categories (and drivers), and daisychain
        device connection support. Instant commands enhanced with TRACKING to
        enable protocol-based waiting for completion of a particular INSTCMD
        or SET operation.
