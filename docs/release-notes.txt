Introduction
============

The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide support
for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies, Power Distribution
Units and Solar Controllers.

This document intends to report high-level changes delivered by NUT project
releases, as well as practical nuances for packagers and end-users who would
be upgrading their NUT deployments.

It DOES NOT intend to detail the change log: it is very large and complicated
to render properly, so is better served by another document artifact.

If you wish to discover how everything came together, have a look at the
