NUT Integration Testing suite (aka NIT)
=======================================

This suite aims to simplify running `upsd`, a `dummy-ups` driver and
a few clients to query them, as part of regular `make check` routine
or separately with existing binaries (should not impact any existing
installation data, processes or communications).

WARNING: Current working directory when starting the script should be
the location where it may create temporary data (e.g. the `BUILDDIR`).

doing a similar job with NUT installed from packages and configuring
it via files in standard path names.

A sandbox prepared by this script can be used for `upsmon` testing:

----
:; make check-NIT-sandbox-devel &

# Wait for sandbox, e.g. test that "${NUT_CONFPATH}/NIT.env-sandbox-ready"
# file appeared; then source the envvars, e.g.:
:; sleep 5 ; while ! [ -e ./tests/NIT/tmp/etc/NIT.env-sandbox-ready ] ; do sleep 1 ; done
:; . ./tests/NIT/tmp/etc/NIT.env

# Prepare upsmon.conf there, e.g.:
:; printf 'MINSUPPLIES 1\nPOWERDOWNFLAG "%s/killpower"\nSHUTDOWNCMD "date >> \"%s/nut-shutdown.log\""\nMONITOR "%s@127.0.0.1:%s" 1 "%s" "%s" primary\n' \
    "$NUT_STATEPATH" "$NUT_STATEPATH" 'dummy' "$NUT_PORT" \
    'dummy-admin' "${TESTPASS_UPSMON_PRIMARY}" \
    > "${NUT_CONFPATH}/upsmon.conf"
----

The `nit.sh` script supports a lot of environment variables to tune its
behavior, notably `NIT_CASE`, `NUT_PORT`, `NUT_STATEPATH` and `NUT_CONFPATH`,
but also many more. See its sources, as well as the top-level `Makefile.am`
recipe and the `./tests/NIT/tmp/etc/NIT.env` file generated during a test run,
for more details and examples about the currently supported tunables.
