NUT contributed and integration scripts
=======================================

These directories hold various scripts and resources needed for systems
integration, and other non-core functionality, which were contributed

  distributions,

  (Linux only),
- `UPower` (previously `DeviceKit-power`) rules file,
- Python Client module and application,

- Augeas support lenses and modules for NUT,
- support to run NUT components as service unit instances:
  * shared `nut-driver-enumerator` and `upsdrvsvcctl` logic,
  * `systemd` support files,
  * SMF (Solaris/illumos Service Management Framework) support files,
- init-scripts and/or packaging elements for several Unix operating systems,
