[Unit]
Description=Enphase API monitor for NUT dummy-ups %I
PartOf=nut-driver.target
# NOTE: Works with individual service instances prepared by nut-driver-enumerator
Before=nut-driver@%i.service

[Service]
SyslogIdentifier=%N
# NOTE: Does not have to be same run-time account as NUT daemons, just the
# files created by it should be readable by the dummy-ups daemon. For more
# secured installations, customize this via a drop-in systemd file with a
# different dedicated account:
User=@RUN_AS_USER@
# NOTE: On systems with wear-prone storage (flash/SSD), you can fiddle with
# a "manually-made" file that would be copied into a tmpfs, and have the
# script (and dummy-ups driver) pick up that tmpfs location with initially
# inherited data points, e.g.:
### ExecStartPre=/bin/cp @CONFPATH@/enphase-%I.default /dev/shm/nut/enphase-%I.seq
# First run once to scrap obsolete data from the existing file
# Replace -s with -x to start in nocomms (no network APIs) below:
ExecStartPre=@NUT_LIBEXECDIR@/enphase-monitor -s %I
# Start as the continuously running service
ExecStart=@NUT_LIBEXECDIR@/enphase-monitor %I
Type=exec
# Restart really always, do not stop trying:
StartLimitInterval=0
Restart=always
RestartSec=30
