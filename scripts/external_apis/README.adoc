NUT external API integration scripts
====================================

These directories hold scripts that help integrate NUT with external APIs
not yet natively supported.  These may include REST API, Web-based JSON,
or any other protocol that doesn't have a supported NUT driver but a
prototype to interact with the device can be easily scripted.  They
are useful both for adding the integration to an existing install, or
as a starting point for creating new integrations.

- `enphase`: web-API based integration with Enphase's locally hosted
  IQ Gateway.

Supports web-based login and token management, and maps JSON data
  to files consumed by the linkman:dummy-ups[8] driver.
