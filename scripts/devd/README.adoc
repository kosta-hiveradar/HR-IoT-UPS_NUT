NUT USB integration resources for FreeBSD devd
==============================================

On FreeBSD, the `devd` subsystem has a similar role to `udev` on Linux.

NOTE: Some FreeBSD based systems rely on "quirks" instead.

The `devd.conf` file defines actions to perform when devices are plugged in.

The `tools/nut-usbinfo.pl` script (under NUT source tree root) generates
the `nut-usb.conf.in` here by processing USB macros in all of the drivers.
In this case, the defined action for each matching UPS is to change the
permissions such that the NUT drivers can access the USB device nodes
without requiring root privileges.

You may need to restart `devd` and re-plug in the UPS (or reboot) after
installation of the file in order to trigger the actions.

The format of this configuration file should work with `devd` on FreeBSD 9.0
and 9.1, at the very least.
